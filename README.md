# SeedQR Templates

This repository contains printable PDF templates for manually creating **SeedQR** backups of your BIP39 recovery phrases (seed words).

## What are these templates?

SeedQR is a standard for storing your wallet's recovery phrase as a QR code that you manually transcribe onto paper or metal. This allows for durable, offline, and air-gapped backups that are easy to scan when restoring a wallet.

These high-quality A4 PDF templates are designed to be printed and filled out by hand.

## Available Templates

Each PDF is formatted for **A4 paper** and contains **4 templates per page** with cutting guidelines.

### 1. Compact SeedQR
A denser, smaller format optimized for metal plates or small storage areas.
- **12 Words:** `compact_seedqr_12word.pdf` (21x21 grid)
- **24 Words:** `compact_seedqr_24word.pdf` (25x25 grid)

### 2. Standard SeedQR
A slightly larger, easier-to-fill format.
- **12 Words:** `standard_seedqr_12word.pdf` (25x25 grid)
- **24 Words:** `standard_seedqr_24word.pdf` (29x29 grid)

## How to Use

1. **Print** the desired PDF template on A4 paper (ensure scale is set to 100%).
2. **Cut** along the dashed lines to separate the four individual cards.
3. **Transcribe** your seed phrase into the QR grid pattern.
4. **Scan** the result with a compatible SeedQR scanner (like SeedSigner or compatible wallet apps) to verify correctness.
